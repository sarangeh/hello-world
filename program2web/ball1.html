wikipedia says,
<br>From Middle English bal, ball, balle, from Old English *beall, *bealla (“round object, ball”) or Old Norse bollr (“a ball”), 
<br>both from Proto-Germanic *balluz, *ballô (“ball”), from Proto-Indo-European *b?oln- (“bubble”), 
<br>from Proto-Indo-European *b?el- (“to blow, inflate, swell”). Cognate with Old Saxon ball, Dutch bal, 
<br>Old High German bal, ballo (German Ball (“ball”); Ballen (“bale”)). Related forms in Romance are borrowings 
<br>from Germanic. See also balloon, bale.
