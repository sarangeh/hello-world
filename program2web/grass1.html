wikipedia says,
<br>
Grass is a monocotyledon plant, herbaceous plants with 
<br>narrow leaves growing from the base. A common kind of 
<br>grass is used to cover the ground in a lawn and other places.

<br>The grasses include the "true grasses", of the family Poaceae 
<br>(also called Gramineae), as well as the sedges (Cyperaceae) 
<br>and the rushes (Juncaceae).[1] These three families are not 
<br>closely related but belong to different clades in the order Poales.
