wikipedia says,
<br>A puppy is a juvenile dog. Some puppies can weigh 1-1.5 kg (1-3 lb), 
<br>while larger ones can weigh up to 7–11 kg (15-23 lb). All healthy puppies 
<br>grow quickly after birth. A puppy's coat color may change as the puppy grows 
<br>older, as is commonly seen in breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier. Puppy refers s
<br>pecifically to young dogs,[1] while pup may be used for other animals such as seals,
<br>giraffes, guinea pigs, rats or sharks.
